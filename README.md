# SVHN
Image Classification using Neural Networks
This is a multiclass classification problem to identify the numbers in the given image. numbers ranging from 0-9.
First we will implement a simple KNN classifier and later implement a Neural Network to classify the images in the SVHN dataset
Exploring deep neural network classifier including feedforwardneural network, RELU activations, backpropagation, cost stochastic gradient descent, cross entropy loss, cost functions, and batch normalization for training the neural network.
